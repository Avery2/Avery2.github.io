    configurations and computation definitions into usable, understandable interfaces
    across products like Data Tables, Metrics, and AI-powered chart interfaces. Worked
    across the full stack, primarily in React and TypeScript, building GraphQL endpoints
    and back-end configuration. Focused on developing analytical tools that were powerful,
    resilient, and accessible.</p><ul>

    later expanded into the company''s <strong>Global Chat</strong> initiative integrating
    LLMs and MCP servers.</li>

    <li>Implemented and maintained <strong>system improvements</strong> such as Dark
    Mode (via new GraphQL endpoints), refactored breakdown tables (tabular data that
    appears under all charts) to use AG Grid, and quick, high-impact UI wins like
    adding tooltips, multiple selection capabilities, and string search bars to improve
    user interaction and trust.</li>

    pricing and packaging.</li>

    <li>Collaborated daily with product, design, and customers to come up with creative
    UI solutions during development and bug resolution, participating in <strong>customer
    calls and bug safaris</strong> to uncover usability issues and propose technical
    solutions aligned with real-world needs; onboarded engineers.</li>

    </ul>

    <li><strong>Full-Stack Growth:</strong></li>

    <ul>

    <li>Remained a front-end specialist while growing into a full-stack contributor
    across design, product, and engineering, integrating <strong>LLM, GraphQL, and
    back-end configuration work</strong> into the analytics ecosystem, valuing the
